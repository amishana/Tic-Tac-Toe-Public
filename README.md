# Tic-Tac-Toe
### Description:<br />
This game follows the rules of the traditional game of "Tic-Tac-Toe" where players compete to place 3 of their characters in a row on a 3 by 3 game board. If choosing to play against another player, each person will be assigned "X" or "O" and take turns inputting a cell number to put their character in. If choosing to play against the computer, either easy or hard mode, the player will choose their spot first as "X" while the computer chooses its spot next as "O". Continue taking turns until one person (or computer) gets 3 of their characters in a row and wins the game, or the board fills up and the game ends in a tie.

### How to Gain Access to the Full Repository:<br />
I submitted this project as a part of a class at UC Santa Cruz, and am not allowed to post it publicly. If you would like to see this project, please message me on LinkedIn (at www.linkedin.com/in/amishanambiar) and I will grant you access. Thank you for your understanding.

### How to Run This Project:<br />
First, install a Python IDE. I used PyCharm for this project, but others such as IDLE or Visual Studio should work as well. Then, download all the files in the repository and open them in your IDE. Run the appropriate tictac file for each type of game you would like to play (tictac_twoPlayer.py for two players, tictac_easyMode.py for an easy game against the computer, or tictac_hardMode.py for a hard game against the computer).<br />
